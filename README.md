# Managing Nested State in React
This was an assignment for my Web Applications Development class. The objective: "Learn to update nested objects in React state using the spread syntax and functional updates to ensure immutability."

# Maintaining Immutability
Through the use of the "useState" hook and the setUserProfile function, none of the original information is directly altered, thus maintaining immutability. The spread syntax also helps to create copies of the data without changing any original values.
